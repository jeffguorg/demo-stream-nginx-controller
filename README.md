# Kubernetes Controller Demo

This project demonstrates how to create a kubernetes controller with kubebuilder.

There is also a blog post describe how i did this: https://blog.jeffthecoder.xyz/posts/kubernetes-crd-controller-with-kubebuilder-impl/. The post is written in Chinese. 

If you are interested to create a controller yourself, you can also start from kubebuilder's documents: https://book.kubebuilder.io/
